''' Implement the following Function : def differenceofSum(n,m)  
â€¢ The function accepts two integers n, m as arguments Find the sum of  all numbers in range from 1 to m(both inclusive) that are not divisible  by n.
Return difference between sum of integers not divisible by n  with sum of numbers divisible by n.  

n : 4
m : 20

Output : 90
