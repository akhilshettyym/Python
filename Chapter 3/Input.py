# input function : This function allows the user to take input from the keyboard as a string.
a = input("Enter the first number :")       # takes input as a string 
b = input("Enter the second number :")
print ("Number a is :", a)
print ("Number b is :", b)
print ("Sum is :", a+b)                     # The sum will be the concatenation of the string 

# For the above problem we will have to use the type as 
a = int(input("Enter the first number :"))  # takes input as an integer
b = int(input("Enter the first number :"))  # takes input as an integer
print ("Sum is :", a+b)
