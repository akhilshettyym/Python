# STRING FUNCTIONS
# Some of the commonly used functions to perform operations on or manipulate strings are as follows.

Name = "akhil"
a = "hymm for the weeknd"
print(len(Name))  # prints the length of the string
print(Name.endswith("hi"))      # String.endswith("rry") – This function_ tells whether the variable string ends with the string or not.
print(Name.endswith("hil"))
print(Name.startswith("a"))
print(Name.capitalize())        # the first character of a given string.
print(Name.upper())
print(Name.lower())
print(Name.capitalize())
print(a.count('e'))     # string.count("c") – counts the total number of occurrences of any character.
print(a.title())
print(Name.find("il"))         # string.find(word) – This function friends a word and returns the index of first occurrence of that word in the string.
print(Name.replace('h','x'))
# print(Name.startswith("a"))

b = " Me a good boy"
print(b.replace("Me","I'm"))

str = "Shetty"
replaced_string = str.replace("t", "l")
print(replaced_string)              # Changes all the occurances.
